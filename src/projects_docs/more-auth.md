Sure, here's an assignment that will help you practice various aspects of Firebase authentication:

### Assignment: Building a Firebase Authentication System

**Objective:**
Build a web application with Firebase authentication that allows users to sign up, log in, log out, and update their profile information.

**Requirements:**

1. **Sign Up Page:**
   - Create a sign-up page where users can register with their email address and password.
   - Implement form validation to ensure that users provide valid email addresses and strong passwords.

2. **Log In Page:**
   - Create a log-in page where registered users can log in using their email address and password.

3. **Forgot Password:**
   - Implement a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their password via email.

4. **Authenticated Routes:**
   - Create a private route that can only be accessed by authenticated users.
   - Redirect users to the log-in page if they attempt to access private routes without being authenticated.

5. **User Profile:**
   - Allow authenticated users to view and update their profile information (e.g., name, email, profile picture).
   - Implement functionality to update the user's password.

6. **Authentication State Management:**
   - Manage the authentication state using Firebase Auth SDK.
   - Display different UI elements based on whether the user is authenticated or not.

7. **Additional Features (Optional):**
   - Implement social authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook) in addition to email/password authentication.
   - Add user roles and permissions to restrict access to certain parts of the application.
   - Implement email verification for newly registered users.
