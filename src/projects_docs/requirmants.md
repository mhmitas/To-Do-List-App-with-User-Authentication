## React, Firebase, and React Router Assignment: To-Do List App with User Authentication

This assignment will solidify your understanding of React, Firebase, and React Router DOM by building a real-world application: a to-do list app with user authentication.

**Features:**

- Users can sign up and log in with Firebase Authentication.
- Users can create, view, edit, and delete to-do items.
- Each user has their own to-do list stored in Firebase Firestore.
- Users can only see and manage their own to-do items.
- Utilize React Router DOM for routing between different views (Login, Signup, To-Do List).

**Here's a breakdown of the functionalities you'll implement:**

1. **Firebase Setup:**
    - Create a Firebase project and enable Authentication and Firestore.
    - Configure your React app to connect with Firebase.

2. **User Authentication:**
    - Develop components for user signup and login using Firebase Authentication methods (email/password, social login).
    - Implement state management for user login status (logged in/logged out).
    - Use React Router to conditionally render Login/Signup or To-Do List based on authentication state.??

3.**User Management:**
    - Allow authenticated users to update their profile information (e.g., display name, profile picture).
    - Implement password reset functionality using Firebase Authentication.
    - Utilize Firebase Authentication custom claims or additional user metadata for role-based access control (e.g., admin users have access to 	additional features).(make it optional)

3. **To-Do List Functionality:**
    - Create a component for displaying the list of to-do items.
    - Develop components for adding new to-do items and editing existing ones (consider using forms).
    - Implement functionality to delete to-do items.
    - Utilize Firestore to store and retrieve to-do items for the logged-in user.
    - Implement additional features to enhance the functionality of the Task Manager application, such as task filtering, sorting, or search 	functionality.

4. **React Router Implementation:**
    - Set up routes for Login, Signup, and To-Do List using `react-router-dom`. // Create separate routes for the dashboard, task 	creation/editing page, and authentication pages (sign-up, sign-in).
    - Implement protected routes that only allow access to the To-Do List when a user is logged in.
    - Utilize `useParams` hook (if needed) to access specific item ID for editing.?

**Bonus Challenges:**

- Implement real-time updates for the to-do list using Firestore Cloud Firestore features.
- Add functionality to mark to-do items as complete.
- Design a user interface using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI.

**Tips:**

- Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Start with basic functionalities and gradually add complexity.
- Use comments in your code to explain the logic.
- Test your app thoroughly after each step.

This assignment will challenge you to integrate these three powerful technologies and provide valuable experience in building web applications with user authentication and data management.
